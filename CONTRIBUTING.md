# Contributing to VAST

First, thanks for your interest in contributing to VAST! We welcome and
appreciate all contributions, including bug reports, feature suggestions,
tutorials/blog posts, and code improvements.

If you're unsure where to start, we recommend our [`good first issue`](https://github.com/trailofbits/vast/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) issue label.

## Bug reports and feature suggestions

Bug reports and feature suggestions can be submitted to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/trailofbits/vast/issues).
For bug reports, attaching the source that caused the bug will help us in
debugging and resolving the issue quickly.

## Questions

Questions can be submitted to the [discussion page](https://github.com/trailofbits/vast/discussions).

## Legal
For legal reasons, we require contributors to sign our [Contributor License
Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/trailofbits/vast).  This will be
automatically checked as part of our CI.

## Code

Manticore uses the pull request contribution model. Please make an account on
Github, fork this repo, and submit code contributions via pull request. For
more documentation, look [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

Some pull request guidelines:

- Minimize irrelevant changes (formatting, whitespace, etc) to code that would
  otherwise not be touched by this patch. Save formatting or style corrections
  for a separate pull request that does not make any semantic changes.
- When possible, large changes should be split up into smaller focused pull
  requests.
- Fill out the pull request description with a summary of what your patch does,
  key changes that have been made, and any further points of discussion, if
  applicable.
- Title your pull request with a brief description of what it's changing.
  "Fixes #123" is a good comment to add to the description, but makes for an
  unclear title on its own.
