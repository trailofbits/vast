### `-vast-export-fn-info`: Create JSON that exports information about function arguments.
Lowers module into llvm IR and dumps it on stderr.

#### Options
```
-o : Output JSON file to be created.
```
### `-vast-hl-dce`: Trim dead code
Removes unreachable code, such as code after return or break/continue.
### `-vast-hl-lower-types`: Lower high-level types to standard types
Lower high-level types into standard types which is usually required first step
by other passes in the pipeline.

Information about bit sizes of high level types is inferred from the data layout of
the module, which is derived from the information provided by clang and emitted
automatically by `vast-cc`.

TODO: Named types are not yet supported.
### `-vast-hl-lower-typedefs`: Remove `hl::TypeDef type from types.
Resolve typedefs types - this is usefull for more low-level analysis
or transformations.
### `-vast-hl-splice-trailing-scopes`: Remove trailing `hl::Scope`s.
Removes trailing scopes.
### `-vast-llvm-dump`: Pass for developers to quickly dump module as llvm ir.
Lowers module into llvm IR and dumps it on stderr.

#### Options
```
-bc-file : Specify file where to dump the bitcode
```
