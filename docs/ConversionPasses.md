### `-vast-abify`: Transform functions and apply abi conversion to their type.
This pass is still a work in progress.
### `-vast-core-to-llvm`: VAST Core dialec to LLVM Dialect conversion
Converts core dialect operations to LLVM dialect.
### `-vast-hl-structs-to-llvm`: Transform hl.struct into llvm types without applying ABI conversions.
This pass is still a work in progress.
### `-vast-hl-to-func`: Lower high-level functions to func.func operations.
Lowers high-level function operations to function dialect.

Drops high-level information like linkage attributes.
### `-vast-hl-to-lazy-regions`: Transform hl operations that have short-circuiting into lazy operations.
This pass is still a work in progress.
### `-vast-hl-to-ll-cf`: VAST HL control flow to LL control flow
Transforms high level control flow operations into their low level
representation.

This pass is still a work in progress.
### `-vast-hl-to-ll-geps`: Convert hl.member to ll.gep
This pass is still a work in progress.
### `-vast-hl-to-ll-vars`: Convert hl variables into ll versions.
This pass is still a work in progress.
### `-vast-irs-to-llvm`: VAST to LLVM Dialect conversion
Converts lowest level VAST operations to LLVM dialect. It is expected
that module being converted was already lowered by other VAST passes.

This pass is still a work in progress.
### `-vast-lower-abi`: Lower abi operations.
This pass is still a work in progress.
