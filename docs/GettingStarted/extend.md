## How to Start Extending VAST?

VAST offers a handy script to generate a variety of MLIR primitives. You can find the script at `scripts/templater.py`. This tool is designed to help you create dialects, passes, operations, types, and attributes interactively.

### Usage

Just run the script. It has been designed to provide a guided process for generating the desired primitives. If you find anything confusing or unintuitive, please don't hesitate to open an issue so that we can address it.

When you run the script, it will generate the basic skeleton for your chosen primitive. It will list the generated files which you can freely modify to provide desired functionality.
